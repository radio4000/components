# web-components for radio4000

These components can be inserted in the HTML of any web pages, and are made to interact with radio4000.com through the use of its
[JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/radio4000/sdk), which talks to Supabase.

## Development

No particular setup is needed, but `node` is useful, here using the package `serve`.

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve locally the project root folder
npm run dev
```
